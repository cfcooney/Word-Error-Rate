# Word-Error-Rate
Python implementation of the Levenstein (edit) distance [1] computation along with word error rate and word accuracy [2].

The three metrics can be used for assessing the performance of an automatic speech recognition system, text-to-speech system
or a brain-computer interface in which speech is decoded from neural signals.
